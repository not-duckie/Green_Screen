<h style="font-size: 50px; text-decoration: underline;">ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h>
<p>Filthy Frank is the embodiment of everything a person should not be. He is anti-PC, anti-social, and anti-couth.
He behaves and reacts excessively to everything expressly to highlight
the ridiculousness of racism, misogyny, legalism, injustice, ignorance and other social blights.
He also sets an example to show how easy it is in the social media for any zany material
to gain traction/followings by simply sharing unsavoury opinions and joking about topics many find offensive.
There is no denying that the show is terribly offensive, but this terrible offensiveness is a deliberate and
unapologetic parody of the whole social media machine and a reflection of the human microcosm that that social
media is. OR MAYBE HE IS JUST FUCKING RETARDED.</p>
